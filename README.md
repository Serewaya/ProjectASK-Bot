# Resource ASK-Bot
Currently starting a business is difficult and keeping a fledgling business afloat is even harder. The level of difficulty increases dramatically for Black owned businesses. Minority-owned businesses have access to less capital than their white counterparts and access to helpful resources in general is incredibly difficult. 

## Resource ASK is an organization that was created to make it easy for Black entrepreneurs to gain access essential resources.
 
### Our Discord bot is a key part of this process.

The Resource ASK Bot is a versatile chatbot that retrieves resource information for Black entrepreneurs across the web. It responds to messages from the user with resource links from a database and google searches.
